# Database Migrations

This directory contains database migration scripts generated by Alembic.

## How to Use Alembic

### Create a New Migration

To create a new migration:

```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description of migration"
```

### Apply Migrations

To apply all pending migrations:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

### Revert Migrations

To revert the last migration:

```bash
alembic downgrade -1
```

To revert to a specific migration:

```bash
alembic downgrade <revision>
```

### Get Migration History

To see the migration history:

```bash
alembic history
```

### Get Current Migration

To see the current migration version:

```bash
alembic current
```

## Best Practices

1. Always review autogenerated migrations before applying them
2. Add tests for complex migrations
3. Keep migrations idempotent when possible
4. Use explicit data migrations for complex data transformations
